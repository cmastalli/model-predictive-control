Trajectory description

This trajectory is a horizontal square of 2 m of width, with the initial position of the quadrotor at the origin.

The noise conditions are simulated with a random number generator taking as a seed value the current time, therefore the seed is never repeated. This noise is restrained to the [-1, 1] range, and is applied to all the states.
