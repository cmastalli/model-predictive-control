\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  KTHEEtitlepage is a \LaTeX package that adds a title page to an
  existing \LaTeX document (internal report, master thesis, licentiate
  thesis or dissertation).
\end{abstract}

\section{How to Use the Package}
Once you have finished your paper/report/thesis/\dots, just add the 
following line somewhere before \verb+\begin{document}+:
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[ireport]{KTHEEtitlepage}
\end{verbatim}
and following commands just below \verb+\begin{document}+:
\begin{verbatim}
\ititle{My Title}
\isubtitle{My Subtitle}
\iauthor{Me and Myself}
\idate{2004}
\irefnr{IR-EE-SB 2000:099}
\iaddress{Signal Processing\\
  School of Electrical Engineering\\
  Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan}
\makeititle
\end{verbatim}

This will add a front page following (as far as possible) the layout
proposed at \url{http://www.kth.se/internt/grafiskprofil/rapporter} in
the example ``Exempel 2 omslag rapport'' (which admittedly is the
least fancy of the tree examples, but also the one that is most likely
to look well when printed on a black/white printer). 

Note that the layout of the original document will remain untouched,
only a new front page is added. If your original document is typeset
for double sided print (using the \verb+twoside+ option to
\verb+\documentclass+, then an empty page will be added after the
front page, so the main document starts on a left side. 


\subsection{Package Options}

The following options are available
\begin{description}
\item[ireport] Front page with layout for internal reports
\item[lic] Front page with layout for licentiate thesis
\item[doktor] Front page with layout for PhD dissertations.
\item[exjobb (default)] Front page with layout for masters thesis.
\item[eng (default)] Logotype and text in English
\item[sve] Logotype and text in Swedish
\item[forWWW (default)] Full layout in color, for WWW publishing.
\item[forPrint] Only the text in black and white, for use when the
  front page will be copied on a preprinted paper that already has the
  logotype and background color. 
\end{description}


\subsection{Optional Commands}

For web publication of documents from IEEE publications, one of the
following commands can be used (above \verb+\makeititle+), to add the
corresponding standard IEEE copyright notice (see the link on ``
Electronic Information Dissemination'' at
\url{http://www.ieee.org/web/publications/rights/polilink_new.html} 
for more information). 

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{$\backslash$submittedIEEE\{\textit{year\}}}] For documents
  submitted to, but not yet accepted by, an IEEE conference or
  journal. 
\item[\texttt{$\backslash$publishedIEEE\{\textit{year\}}}] For documents
  copyrighted by an IEEE conference or journal. 
\end{description}

These commands only apply to internal reports, not to any of the
thesis options.
