## Model Predictive Control Experimental ##

---

This code implement a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm over Robot Operating System (ROS). The main goal is develop a MPC that will be modularity and easy to implement in any robots under ROS, and it will be reusable to other kind of algorithm like LBMPC. It also have to be implementable in fast dynamics platforms like underwater robots and quadrotors.
Besides, this code will be implemented in our underwater robot called **PoseiBot**. Finally, this code is part of Mechatronic Research Group of Simon Bolivar University.

## Milestones ##
1- To develop a MPC that can compute in real-time the control actions for any robot.
2- To develop a code that be easy to implement in any robot. Beside it can be use in other algorithms like motion planning based of model predictive control.
3- To implement and test this code in PoseiBot.
4- To study the development of lbmpc because it appear to have good performance.
