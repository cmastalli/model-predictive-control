In this chapter the results of the application of the developed MPC application on two different platforms is shown and discussed. The first platform is the simulator for a well known tank system present here at the Control labs. This system was developed as a small test platform of the software before using it on the quadrotor simulator. The second platform is the simulator for the quadrotor, which comes from the modeling effort made in chapter three. For each platform, the structure to present the results will be divided in three sections: Simulation settings and parameters, Results and Discussion.

\section{Tank system simulations}

\subsection{Simulation settings and parameters}

The tank system's equations were provided with their correspondent identified parameters. The system is made of two tanks that are connected by gravity: one tank provides the inflow for the other and from there to a water deposit. There is also a small pump, its operation voltage represents the input to the system. The states of the system are the two tank level, of which the desired output is the level of the second  tank.  The system is depicted below as in Figure \ref{fig:tank_system}:

\label{fig:tank_system}
\end{figure}

The constraints on the system arise from the size of the tanks, that limit the level of water that the system can handle. The constraints for the levels of the tanks, $H_1$ and $H_2$ respectively, and the input voltage are shown below:

\begin{equation*}
0 \leq H_1 \leq 25 [cm] \\
0 \leq \H_2 \leq 28 [cm] \\
0 \leq V \leq 10 [V]
\end{equation*}

Regarding the tuning of MPC, the parameters available to adjust are the horizons and the weight matrices in the cost function. The selection of a proper prediction horizon for any MPC application is dependant on the dynamics of the system that is being controlled.  This choice is of great influence in the size of the optimization problem to solve, and therefore in the computational power required to provide deterministic operation. If the horizon is too short, the prediction won't give information about future control signals and might create unstability in the controller \cite{Gabrielsson2012}. On the other hand, if the horizon is too long, the optimization problem to solve could be too large to solve in each time sample, depending on the timing requirements for each case. The selected prediction horizon of 10 samples at a rate of 100 Hz was obtained starting from small values, where the optimization problems were mostly unfeasible, and increasing until feasibility was achievef, as well as a decent control signal. Further tuning is made with the weight matrices. The weight matrices are also selected in a trial and error fashion. \\

The specifications for the simulation of the MPC on the tank system is presented below.

\section{Quadrotor simulations}

\subsection{Simulation settings and parameters}

Since the quadrotor has only four actuators to move in six degrees of freedom, it is an underactuated system. Hence, there will be only four variables that will be controllable. The choice made was to control the $x, y, z$ positions and the orientation around the $z$ axis ($\psi$). It is important to mention that the MPC is not sending directly the input signals going to the motors. The reason for this is that the model that is being used to perform the calculations is a linearized model, therefore the state and input variables represent deviations around an operation point. The MPC is instead controlling these linearized input variables and sending that to modify the initial operation point. The operation point being used is calculated by simple force balance in the hover condition, to obtain the required angular speed of the rotors to keep the quadrotor static in the air, which is approximately $360$ radians per second. That way, the control signal vector going to the quadrotor simulator is built as follows:

\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{u} = \underbrace{\mathbf{\bar{u}}}_\textrm{operation point} + \underbrace{\Delta \mathbf{u}}_\textrm{controlled by MPC}
\end{equation*}

In order to adjust to this, the constraints in the input were also modified, through a displacement of the operation range for this variation of the angular speed. The original operation range is taken from the experiments realized by Sun \cite{YueSun2012}, which is $130 \leq \omega_{i} \leq 500$, in radians per second. In order to be congruent with that range, the variation of the angular speed is limited between $-230 \leq \Delta \omega_{i} \leq 140$ around the operation point, again in radians per second.\\ 

In this particular case, the tuning of the MPC is also influenced by the model, since the one being used for prediction is a linearized version. A very long prediction in the future might mean moving too far away from the operation point, which will cause erratic predictions due to nonlinearities, additionally to the increase of the computation time. Also, these erratic prediction may lead the controller to unfeasibility and therefore unstability. In this system that is not stable in open loop, this could mean crashing the quadrotor. The selected prediction horizon of 30 samples at a rate of 120 Hz is long enough to give good predictions ahead for the system while keeping the size of the problem decent. This  result was obtained by trial and error.\\

With the weight matrices, the procedure is also made in a trial and error fashion. A good initial guess for the quadrotor model is taken from previous implementation parameters \cite{Bouffard2012}. The simulation is performed in a computer with an Intel \textsuperscript{\textregistered} Core\texttrademark 2 Duo running at 3.0 GHz. The complete specifications for the simulation are presented in the following table.

    \begin{tabular}{| l | p{7cm} |}

    State constraints &  -5 \leq V_x \leq 5 [m]  \newline -5 \leq V_y \leq 5 [m] \newline 0 \leq z \leq 5 [m] \\ \hline

The trajectory reference used to test the MPC in the quadrotor simulator is based in simple decoupled movements in each one of the controlled directions, done one at a time. The movement consists on four stages: elevation from the floor, change in orientation (a change in the yaw angle), rotating back to the original orientation, and movements in the $X$ and $Y$ axes, in that order.

\subsection{Discussion}

The simulations show the performance of the MPC strategy in the simulated quadrotor. Figures \ref{fig:ardrone_pos} and \ref{fig:ardrone_ang} show the position and orientation  response of the system against step input signals on each controlled variable. The response shown presents a smooth behavior, no overshoot and a small settling time correspondant to a fast system like the quadrotor. The prediction horizon used, $N_p = 30$, has a right balance in speed to allow a fast response without overshoot.\\

The initial set of restrictions considered was bigger than the one used in the simulations shown, since there were restrictions considered on the roll and pitch angles ($\phi$ and $\theta$) taken in order to assure the stability of the quadrotor. Normally, this would be addressed by a hovering PI control loop in the original AR-Drone control architecture. However, the consideration of the constraints on these angles lead to unfeasibility in the quadratic programming problem, so  these restrictions were relaxed, and eventually dropped. The stability of the platform was addressed by strenghtening the restrictions on the velocities in the $x$ and $y$ axes, since these velocities are dependant on the roll and pitch angles. \\

The actual version of the library does not include functions to cope with unfeasibility. This must be considered in further stages of development in order to provide a better operation under the presence of more constraints. Some suggested strategies to cope with unfeasibility are referred by Camacho and Bordons \cite{CamachoBordons}: an initial strategy consists of dropping the state constraints at the initial portion of the horizon in order to make the problem feasible; another way is to create soft constraints from the hard constraints stated initially, and then adding a term in the cost function to penalize constraint violation. Feasibility is important to assure closed-loop stability. One could also use the solution of the unconstrained problem  when unfeasibility appears, but this will not guarantee stability.\\
