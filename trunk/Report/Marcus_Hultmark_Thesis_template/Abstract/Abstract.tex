The focus of this report is centered around Model Predictive Control (MPC) and its application. In this project, there are two main goals: first, is to develop a library that works as a infrastructure when building MPC applications; second, to apply this library to a particular application of interest in the research group such as the quadrotor drone. Chapter 2 presents the mathematical base of knowledge to understand MPC, and it also explains the key elements present in it. In Chapter 3, the focus is on the modeling of the quadrotor platform based on the physic laws that rule the dynamics of the drone. Several tests are made in order to verify the resulting model. The resulting model works satisfactorily and is the base of the MPC controller. A thorough description of the MPC library architecture is made in Chapter 4, in order to give insight about how it works internally. The proposed architecture allows benefits proper of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). The library is tested on two simulators developed by the author: one of a well known water tank system in the Control Lab at Simon Bolivar Univerisity, and the simulator of the quadrotor itself. In both cases the controller presents good performance, but in the case of the quadrotor it requires a lot of computational power to implement it in real-time, or to cut the cpu time via software and use the suboptimal solutions of the MPC.
